WARNING: Work in progress

This guide explains how to use http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/php/start-using-sdk.html[Couchbase PHP SDK] to store and retrieve a JSON document in http://developer.couchbase.com/server[Couchbase].

== What you'll build

Couchbase is an open source NoSQL document database. It can be programmed using a variety of languages. This guide will show how to write a simple PHP application to store a JSON document representing a Book JSON document in Couchbase Server using the Couchbase PHP SDK.

== What you'll need

* 15-30 minutes
* A PHP code editor
* http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads[Couchbase Server 4.5+]

== Setup

=== Install and Start Couchbase

Install and start Couchbase for your operating system as explained at: http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/getting-started/installing.html. A default bucket by the name `default` is created.

Open up Couchbase Web Console at http://localhost:8091, go to the Query tab, create a primary index using `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX on default` and click on Execute button to create the index.

=== Install PHP Client SDK

Couchbase PHP Client SDK can be installed on different operating systems. Complete set of instructions are available at http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/php/start-using-sdk.html. OSX specific instructions are given below.

Installing PHP Client SDK on OSX requires to install brew package manager. This in turn requires to install XCode and the process could take a few minutes depending upon your connectivity.

. Download and Install https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[XCode].
. Install the XCode CLI tools as `xcode-select --install`.
. Install `brew` package manager as:
+
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor
```
+
. Now you are ready to install Couchbase PHP libraries:
+
```
brew install libcouchbase
```
+
. PHP interpreter needs to be configured to load the Couchbase SDK as an extension. This needs to be done in the standard PHP configuration file - `php.ini`. The exact location of this file can be found using `php --ini` command. This shows the output as:
+
```
Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /etc
Loaded Configuration File:         /etc/php.ini
Scan for additional .ini files in: /Library/Server/Web/Config/php
Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)
```
+
The second line shows the location of the configuration file. In our case, the value is `/etc/php.ini`. If `(none)` value is shown then that means no configuration file exists. Typically, a default file such as `/etc/php.ini.default` can be copied over to `/etc/php.ini` in this case.

== Code

== Create Application

In your favorite editor, create a new file `app.php`. Copy the following code in that file:

[source,php]
----
ADD CODE
----

Couchbase Go library, defined by `gopkg.in/couchbase/gocb.v1` is used in this class.

A new Go struct named `Book` is defined that mimics the JSON document structure. `Connect` method creates a connection to the Couchbase node identified by `localhost`. The `default` bucket is opened using the `OpenBucket` method.

A JSON document is upserted in the bucket. The word `"Upsert"` comes from `"update"` and `"insert"`. So this method will either insert the document if it does not exist, or update if it already exists. A fresh install of Couchbase has an empty `default` bucket. So the document will be inserted for the first run. Subsequent runs of this application will update the document.

A key is given to identify the document, this is `book1` in our case. The document itself is the JSON fragment and is second parameter of the method.

The inserted document can be easily accessed using `bucket.Get()` method by passing the key used during the creation. Value of the document can be retrieved using `.value`.

All documents from the bucket can be easily retrieved using http://couchbase.com/n1ql[N1QL] query as well.

== Run

=== Build Application

Open a terminal or command prompt and give the following command to build the application:

```
go buid app.go
```

This will compile the source code and generate the binary file.

=== Run Application

In the same directory, run the application by giving the command:

```
app
```

It will show the output as:

[source, text]
----
Book: {978-1-4919-1889-0 Minecraft Modding with Forge 29.99}
Row: map[default:map[name:Minecraft Modding with Forge cost:29.99 isbn:978-1-4919-1889-0]]
----

The first result comes from `bucket.Get("u:book1", &inBook)` method. The second line comes from executing the N1QL query and iterating over all the documents.

== Summary

Congratulations! You set up a Couchbase server and wrote a simple Go application that stores and retrieves a JSON document in Couchbase.
